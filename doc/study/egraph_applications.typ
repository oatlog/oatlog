= babble: Learning Better Abstractions with E-Graphs and Anti-unification

Using e-graphs, try to find what standard library functions would be useful.

Anti unification turns 3 + 1 and 2 + 1 into X + 1

E-graphs can be used to generate a minimal set of small rewrite rules that are equivalent to a large set of rewrite rules.
The generated rules run significantly faster.
