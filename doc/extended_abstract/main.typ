        We introduce oatlog, an e-graph engine implementing the egglog language. Like the egglog
        library, it is intended for equality saturation (EqSat) and is implemented as a relational
        database using semi-naive evaluation. While egglog is implemented as an interpreter to ease
        interactive use-cases, oatlog is a Rust procedural macro that embeds EqSat theories into
        applications.

        At the cost of some dynamism, its ahead-of-time compilation of theories makes it easier to
        understand and debug theory synthesis as one can inspect the relatively readable generated
        Rust code. In particular, this greatly simplifies performance engineering for oatlog.
        Additionally, although it is entirely possible in an interpreter, the ahead-of-time
        architecture naturally lends itself to relation and whole-ruleset optimization. Relation
        indexes can for example be found equal given some rule, such as $"Add"(a,b,c)="Add"(b,a,c)$
        given commutativity or $"Add"(a,b,c) = "Sub"(c,b,a)$. Rewrites within a ruleset can also be
        optimized assuming the existence of other rewrites in the ruleset.

        Oatlog is in-progress work and lacks many features present in egglog. Important features not
        yet implemented include executing rulesets other than the entire set of rules, extraction
        and `:merge` which is necessary for lattice-based reasoning.

        In microbenchmarks, particularly for fast-growing theories, oatlog is faster than egglog.
        This is primarily due to using static indexes, specifically static BTrees, that are
        recreated rather than mutated during rebuilding. We are planning to address this further, by
        accelerating the innermost loop of BTree traversal with SIMD and by adaptively using a
        dynamic instead of static index data structure, in addition to other ongoing work on
        whole-ruleset optimization and on improving egglog parity.

    Comparative testing of oatlog and egglog using egglog's test suite.

    The `zrocorrect` verdict is broken out from `allcorrect` since oatlog ignores the `check`
    command, which usually is crucial to those tests. Oatlog compares the number of e-nodes in its
    e-graph to that of egglog, while stepping forwards in a matter equivalent to repeatedly applying
    `(run 1)`.

    The two `does_panic` cases involve panics within egglog and the `mismatched` case is due to
    `check` commands creating e-nodes as a side effect, and oatlog ignoring all `check` commands.

== Oatlog

Our work introduces oatlog, a rewrite engine compatible with the egglog language. Like egglog, it
can be seen as a Datalog engine with support for unification. Unlike egglog, it compiles rules
ahead-of-time (aot$#h(2pt)approx#h(2pt)$oat) which allows query planning and index selection to be
optimized globally.

#TODO[Functional dependency to fixpoint per table, recreating other indexes.]

= Oatlog implementation <oatlog_implementation>

#TODO[Elaborate and forward reference]

This section discusses oatlog in detail, including how its used, what it can do and how its
implemented.

== Egglog-compatible external interface

Oatlog is invoked as a Rust proc macro `oatlog::compile_egraph!`, to which the user can provide
either a string literal or an S-expression in the form of Rust tokens directly, as seen in
@compile_egraph_invokation. The input is parsed as a theory in the egglog language.

#figure(
  ```rust
    // Egglog as a string literal
    oatlog::compile_egraph!("
      (datatype Math
        (Mul Math Math)
        (Add Math Math)
      )
      (rewrite (Mul (Add a b) c) (Add (Mul a c) (Mul b c)))
    ");
    // Egglog as an S-expression of Rust tokens
    oatlog::compile_egraph!((
      (datatype Math
        (Mul Math Math)
        (Add Math Math)
      )
      (rewrite (Mul (Add a b) c) (Add (Mul a c) (Mul b c)))
    ));
  ```,
  caption: [Usage examples of `oatlog::compile_egraph!`.],
) <compile_egraph_invokation>

We are planning to implement user-specified primitive functions by allowing Rust code to be written
inline with the S-expressions.

Oatlog currently lacks support for

+ #[Primitive functions, i.e. non-partial functions with exclusively primitive arguments and return
    values, implemented as Rust functions directly such as `i64::add` or `i64::mul`.]
+ #[Lattice functions, i.e. partial functions returning primitives updated through `:merge`.]
+ #[Containers, such as sets and multisets containing non-primitives.]
+ #[Running arbitrary schedules.]

Finally, oatlog has a run-time API that allows insertion and querying of rows and e-classes,
realized through functions implemented on the `Theory` type in the code generated by the
`oatlog::compile_egraph!` macro.

== Benchmarks


== Egglog test suite

We run the entire egglog testsuite (93 tests) to validate oatlog.
We compare the number of e-classes in egglog and oatlog to check if oatlog is likely producing the same result.

Right now, we fail most tests because primitive functions are not implemented. Additionally, some
tests are not very relevant for AOT compilation and supporting them is not really desirable. An
example of this are extraction commands, since egglog-language-level commands are run at oatlog
startup and oatlog extraction is better handled using the run-time API.

= Benchmarks <appendix_benchmarks>

Benchmarks involve running oatlog and egglog on the same inputs, the theories specified below, and
taking the average time over many runs. The `fuel2-math` and `fuel3-math` benchmarks run until
convergence while the `math` and `boolean_adder` benchmarks are run for $9$ steps.

== `fuel2-math`, `fuel3-math` and `math`

The `math` benchmark is adapted from `egglog`'s `tests/math-microbenchmark.egg`. The benchmarks
`fuel2-math` and `fuel3-math` are variants that limit how many levels of integration by parts are
performed, giving a theory that converges.

== Boolean adder

(non-incrementally-updated) indexes for fast-growing theories.

= Oatlog example usage

This example proves that if $x = -b + sqrt(b^2 - c)$ then $x^2 + 2 b x + c = 0$. If oatlog
implemented extraction this example could be adapted to not just verify this, but to find the
quadratic equation itself, but that is not (yet) the case.
