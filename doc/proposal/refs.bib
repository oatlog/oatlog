  abstract = {We present egglog, a fixpoint reasoning system that unifies Datalog and equality saturation (EqSat). Like Datalog, egglog supports efficient incremental execution, cooperating analyses, and lattice-based reasoning. Like EqSat, egglog supports term rewriting, efficient congruence closure, and extraction of optimized terms. We identify two recent applications -- a unification-based pointer analysis in Datalog and an EqSat-based floating-point term rewriter -- that have been hampered by features missing from Datalog but found in EqSat or vice-versa. We evaluate our system by reimplementing those projects in egglog. The resulting systems in egglog are faster, simpler, and fix bugs found in the original systems.},

abstract = {An e-graph efficiently represents a congruence relation over many expressions. Although they were originally developed in the late 1970s for use in automated theorem provers, a more recent technique known as equality saturation repurposes e-graphs to implement state-of-the-art, rewrite-driven compiler optimizations and program synthesizers. However, e-graphs remain unspecialized for this newer use case. Equality saturation workloads exhibit distinct characteristics and often require ad-hoc e-graph extensions to incorporate transformations beyond purely syntactic rewrites.  This work contributes two techniques that make e-graphs fast and extensible, specializing them to equality saturation. A new amortized invariant restoration technique called rebuilding takes advantage of equality saturation's distinct workload, providing asymptotic speedups over current techniques in practice. A general mechanism called e-class analyses integrates domain-specific analyses into the e-graph, reducing the need for ad hoc manipulation.  We implemented these techniques in a new open-source library called egg. Our case studies on three previously published applications of equality saturation highlight how egg's performance and flexibility enable state-of-the-art results across diverse domains.},
